# ethereum-simulator

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kumavis/ethereum-simulator.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A playground for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) crypto-contracts.
Inspect contracts, activate them with a transaction, and try your hand at creating your own.

More information about ethereum available [on the forums](http://forum.ethereum.org/).
Meet others on freenode using [a webclient](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ethereum) or [your own](irc://chat.freenode.net/ethereum).

I originally built this to help teach myself how crypto-contracts work.
Interest from the community has prompted me to develop it into an interactive tutorial.
It is still a crude prototype, and a work in progress.
Please let me know how we might improve it by [filing an issue](https://github.com/k1n0k0/ethereum-simulator/issues/new).

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

Next, we can bring down the repo, and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/k1n0k0/ethereum-simulator.git
cd ethereum-simulator
npm install
```

Now let's run it!
```
npm start
```
